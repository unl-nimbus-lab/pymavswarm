# pymavswarm Examples

Several examples have been implemented to demonstrate how to use and extend the
`pymavswarm` library. The implemented examples include:

- `arming.py`: demonstrates how to arm and disarm swarm agents
- `check_state.py`: demonstrates how to check the state of swarm agents
- `companion_computer.py`: demonstrates how to send commands from a companion
computer
- `custom_observer.py`: demonstrates how to implement a callback for an agent
state change
- `set_flight_mode.py`: demonstrates how to set the agents' flight mode
- `set_home_position.py`: demonstrates how to set the swarm agents' home
position
- `set_parameter.py`: demonstrates how to set an agent's parameter
- `subclass_mavswarm.py`: demonstrates how to extend the functionality of
`MavSwarm`
- `takeoff_sequence.py`: demonstrates how to execute a full takeoff sequence
