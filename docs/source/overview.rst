`pymavswarm` is a Python library implemented to enable interaction with drone
swarms using the MAVLink protocol. This library supports reading MAVLink
messages sent from multiple agents in a swarm and sending MAVLink messages to
agents within the swarm. Such functionality ultimately enables development of
new swarm applications such as ground control stations.
